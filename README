Worldclock is a clock that displays the time with words.

All the words needed to display any possible time are available and only the ones
required to display the (approximate) current time are turned on.
The time will be accurate to within five minutes. 

Our first thought was to use the five minute time closest to the current time 
so we're never more than 2.5 minutes out.  

Another suggestion was to switch to the correct time at every
five minute boundary, then maintain that to the next five minute boundary.

The second idea is liekly easier to program and would require less explaining
to people.


Some suggested layouts:

Half Quarter
Twenty Five Ten
Past To One Two
Three Four Five
Six Seven Eight
Nine Ten Eleven
Twelve O'Clock

Ten Quarter Twenty Five
Half Past To One Two
Three Four Five Six
Seven Eight Nine Ten
Eleven Twelve O'Clock
