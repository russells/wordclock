Subject: Allow two consecutive TWI operations.

We will very commonly want to do two operations on the DS1307 - write
to it to set the current register address, then read from that
register or series of registers.  The TWI way to do such a thing is to
use a REPEATED START so you don't lose control of the bus between the
operations, so we allow that.
